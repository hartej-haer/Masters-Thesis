The ipynb files are a sample of the code used in my Master's thesis 'Sentiment Analysis for Predicting S&P 500 Movements". The abstract can be seen below.

Abstarct: Stock price and market trend forecasting is a challenging issue due to the many variables, both known and unknown, where a time series element adds another layer of complexity. Investors are constantly looking for an edge in the market for improved predictions to maximise profits while academics look to provide evidence for different stock prediction theories.

More recently, with the rise of social media platforms, the potential of sentiment analysis has been explored further as a predictor of stock price movements. Specifically, the aims of this study were to investigate if sentiment analysis can improve stock trend prediction and to compare Reddit and Twitter to the standard benchmark, Financial News, as a source of sentiment analysis.

Furthermore, the purpose of the thesis was to investigate the classification performance of Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Extreme Gradient Boosting in predicting the daily trend movement of the S&P 500, with and without the addition of sentiment analysis from Reddit, Twitter and News as a feature. Moreover, the performance metrics indicated a positive difference between the modelsâ€™ using sentiment and not using sentiment. The average accuracy with sentiment for News, Twitter, and Reddit, across all three models, are 55.2%, 63% and 62.2%, respectively. The Mathews Correlation Coefficient reported that News attains a score of 0.122, Twitter at 0.063 and Reddit at 0.125. With sentiment applied, the error rate improved by 16% for News, 21% for Twitter and 13% for Reddit.

Overall, the work provided evidence that sentiment is a viable and valuable variable for stock prediction. Reddit and Twitter have shown to have an advantage over News as a source of textual data. However, the work comparing Reddit vs. Twitter was not conclusive, but Reddit seemed to have an edge in this study due to its unrestrictive word length. The work enhanced the field of stock prediction and gave evidence to disprove that the stock market can only be predicted at random accuracy.
